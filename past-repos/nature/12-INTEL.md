1. How do you get your wisdoms?

    Reading. 
    
    Extract from Experience (Rubbish One)
    
    Other people's doctrines. 
    
    Tags and jargons

2. Why you want to be smarter.
    
    Life is all about solving. And solving needs learning.

3. Formal education: Both benefits and side effects.

4. How to learn faster:

    - Utilize your default functionality (sub-conscious)
    - Visual(ICON). Animation(STORY, CAUSATIONS). Extrapolate. Mapping.
    - Practice to create chuck. From scary and overwhelming to familiar and fluent. (Like Hunt in a new Env?) 
    - Abstract and Connect.
    - Study the foundations of subjects.

When you stuck, it might be some ambiguities occurs, or a lack of dependency errors, or it simply used up all your resources and makes you unable to be compute any longer.  get clarification.

To me the hard part is always about this abstraction weakness, like hanging on the cliffs.

Less is more. Less means no need of making choices. Less means less to compute and parse with.
