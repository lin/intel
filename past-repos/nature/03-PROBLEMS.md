# PROBLEMS

1. Problems
    
    What is Problems? Computation. Symbolic Manipulations
    
    Find and Proof.
    
2. Techniques

    **The robustness of techniques.**
    
    (Complexity in terms of computations. Time consuming.)
    
    Does it break often?
    
    **The solving radius of techniques.**
    
    (Assumptions like axioms, how far you can reach no matter how long it takes you to get there). The larger the radius, the looser the constraint. The lower the abstraction level of the problem.
    
    Axiom Robustness. `x^4 - 3 x^2 - 4 = 0`
    
    Generally, larger radius means less robust.
    
    Ad Hoc computation has radius of 1.
    
    Symbolic Manipulation has radius of N.
    
    **Types of Techniques**
    
    Weak Strategies means high volume of computational cost.
    
    **The Dependency of Techniques**
