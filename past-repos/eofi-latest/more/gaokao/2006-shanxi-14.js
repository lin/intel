// all is identical in some sense, that means all is identical in terms of being an separatable object.
// but some are an instance of a class as a pattern that can be checked through computation.
// it's barbarian compute if you brutal force to calculate it out.
// so it means we have to find a way to represent the way human thinks.
// what's easy for human to think, what is not easy.

// We have to work with abstraction like working with 0s and 1s.
// There are lots of unknown lands and revolutions out there to break through.
