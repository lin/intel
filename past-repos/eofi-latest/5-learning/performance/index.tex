\section{Testing the Performance}

\subsection*{Definitions}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Able to recognize the definition in the context
  \item Able to replace with definition to produce a new state
  \item Able to verify whether one instant belongs to a class
  \item Able to provide instants of a class
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Axiom-Like Conclusions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Understand these are the derivative, not truth by default
  \item Able to remember the result
  \item Able to recognize and apply in the context
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Algorithmically}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Able to recognize the occurance of the problem
  \item Able to remember the procedure fluently
  \item Able to apply each step of computation reliablely
\end{enumerate}

Sometimes, we can use this chapter to denote the work type in real life.

Some jobs solve the problem near algorithmically, like bus drivers. The taxi drivers have to deal with more abudant situations than bus drivers.

The job of a cook is also most of time algorithmical, producing the food according to recipes reliablely everyday to satisfy the needs of customers.

\subsection*{Symbolically}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Able to use symbols to denote otherwise concrete concepts
  \item Able to deduce and work comfortably using symbols
  \item Able to use theoroms and equations to get the solutions
\end{enumerate}
