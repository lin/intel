\subsection*{Indistinguishability}

\subsubsection*{Simulation of the World}

If you play a lot of video games, sometimes you can't distinguish it from reality.

While you watch a visual effect movie, you sometimes can't distinguish it from reality or magic.



\subsubsection*{Relativity Theories}

The principle of relativity states that you can't distinguish systems of reference by testing laws of physics.

For the general relativity, it starts with a thought experiment by Einstein, that you can't distinguish from an elevator falls freely and a space elevator accelarates at the same rate as gravitational acceleration.


\subsubsection*{Turing Test}

We couldn't distinguish from real people and artificial intelligence.

In some narrow areas, like shown by using Google Duplex to make a restaurant reservation.
