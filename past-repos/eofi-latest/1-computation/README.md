Outline:

1. symbols of distinguishable information
1. composition of the symbols
1. the transformation of the compositions.

c s t has six variance:

1. composition of symbols
1. composition of transformations
1. symbolization of composition
1. symbolization of transformation
1. transformation of symbols
1. transformation of composition

computation is a known setup to get a deterministic result.

from computation we can have:

1. the equivalence of computation, f_1 === f_2
1. the equivalence forms of information based on the equivalence of computation
1. the classification `@ -> O`
1. the learning `@ -> @`
