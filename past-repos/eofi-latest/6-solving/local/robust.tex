\subsection{Symbolic Techniques}

Let's start with a simple example:

\begin{example}
  Simplify $\dfrac{10}{2- i}$
\end{example}

While if you only know the definition as $i^2 = -1$, it will still be a highly difficult problem to solve. And you would find it hard to remove $i$ in denominator. But if you learn a technique, this problem would be easy. What you do would be confidently compute without thinking.

Here we would discuss the importancy of robost techniques, especially these symbolic techniques.



\begin{example}
  Solve $\begin{cases}
  x + y = 10 \\
  x - y = 2
\end{cases}$
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  For $a_n = n2^n$, what is its sum $S_n$?
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Solve $2x^2 - x - 1 = 0$
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  If $x + 2y = 3$, what is the minimum of $\dfrac{2}{x} + \dfrac{1}{y}$?
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  In $\Delta ABC$, $A = \dfrac{\pi}{3}, a = 2$, what is the range of its circumference?
\end{example}
