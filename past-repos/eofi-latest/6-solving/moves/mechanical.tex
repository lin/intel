\subsection{Mechanical Moves}

Most of time, we solve problems using chunks, react situations as knee-jerk reactions.

So in the solving of problems, it's simply too much computational cost if you keep redo everything instead of remembering it.

To solve hard problems, you need to learn, you need to build your resource repository, your own toolbox, your data to induct inspirations from.

For the mortals, a person who is able to solve problems fast and reliable only because of his or her massive training on the subjects, their emerge on the subjects and see too much patterns and be comfort with so much situations, that lets them able to react new situation as if they are deal with the old, with a little bit of abstraction ability most people have.


\begin{example}
  What is the period of $f(x) = \sin x \cos x + \cos^2 x$
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  If a circle passes points $(1,2), (3,4), (5,6)$, what is the equation of the circle?
\end{example}
