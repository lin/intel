\subsection{Computational Cost as Human Pains}
\subsection{Sensitivity of Computation Cost}

The opportunity cost is everywhere in life. You can't do everything as perfect as you want and you have to make the tradeoff like all the time. But human I think have the ability of sensing this computation cost.

\section{Reduction of Computation}
There are two types of reduction.
1. Reduction by String Replacement.
2. Recognize as a class object and reduction by Replacement.
\subsection{Reduction by Shortcuts}
\subsection{Reduction by Theoroms}

\section{Computational Irreducibility}
\subsection{Principle of Least Computation}
\subsection{Cecullar Automata}
\subsection{GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorems}

\section{Depth of Complexity}
\subsection{Learnable Regularity}
\subsection{Explorable Complexity}
\subsection{Meaningless Chaos}
\subsection{Lucky Configurations}

Back to the past, you could be able to buy bitcoin at year 2010, that means you can proactively find bitcoin and buy a large amount of it. But that only means things have already been rolled out.

\subsection{Scale of Science}

\section{Randomness and Probability}
\subsection{Incomputable Situations}
